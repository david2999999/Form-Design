Forms is the one of the most important type of interaction for users on the web and in the apps. 
They are used everywhere — for registration, subscription services, customer feedback, checkout, 
to initiate transactions between users and companies, or as data input to search or share information. 
Developers should pay special attention to improving their forms and making them as usable as possible,
because careful form design has a huge impact on the speed with which users can accurately complete a form.
